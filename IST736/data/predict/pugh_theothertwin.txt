THE OTHER TWIN

By EDWIN PUGH


It was the hour of siesta. Santa Plaza lay blistering, sweltering, in
the white-hot glare of the noontide sun. The dust lay thick on the roads
and terraces, the copings and the roofs of the houses, like untrodden
snow. The sea shone like a shield of brass reflecting a brassy sky.
There was not the least sign of movement anywhere.

Then Franker, the Englishman, came limping along the Lido, sat down in
the shadow of the old sea-wall, and examined with grave solicitude a
swollen and blistered foot swathed in filthy, blood-stained rags.

This Franker had once been a well-known figure in all the ports of those
far-off southern seas. It was whispered that in the long ago he had been
a gentleman. Now he was just the sport of circumstance, a jack of all
trades, so long as they were indifferent honest; sailorman, stock-rider,
storekeeper, croupier, crimp, anything that happened along in his hour
of need. But lately he had disappeared from his old haunts, and it was
unlikely that any of his old acquaintances would have recognised in that
ragged and gaunt, unwashed and black-bearded wastrel on the beach the
spruce adventurer of former days.

He had the look of a hunted creature. There was fear in his eyes. Even
as he sat there nursing his aching foot, parched and hungry, haggard and
weary, his head was perpetually turning from side to side, and ever and
again he looked over his shoulder, to left and right, as if he were in
dread expectation that at any moment some enemy might creep upon him
unawares. And, indeed, he was in parlous case. For he had killed a man,
not in itself an exceptional incident of course—only in this instance
the man was one of twins, and the other twin had vowed a vendetta
against him.

These twins were named Bibi and Bobo, and the extraordinary likeness
between them was accentuated by their habit of always dressing alike,
talking alike, thinking alike. There were some who said that they could
distinguish one twin from the other, but these were foolish,
vainglorious men. The thing was manifestly impossible. Even Franker did
not know whether it was Bibi or Bobo he had killed.

It happened in a gambling den in Suranim, up country. They were playing
the childish game of boule, and some silly dispute had arisen. Franker
had lost his temper, and knocked one of the twins down. For once in a
way the other twin had not been present, or most assuredly Franker would
have been chived in the back before he could turn round. As it was, he
saw his fallen adversary rise slowly, slowly draw a red smear across his
face with the back of his hand, and then quicken on a sudden into antic
activity. There was the flash of a knife. Franker dodged. The other men
stood back to watch the fun—not to see fair play. Fair play was a jewel
of little value in the estimation of that crew. A moment Franker
hesitated, then whipped out his gun and fired point-blank at the twin.
He dropped dead. Before the smoke had cleared away or the echoes of the
report had subsided into stillness, Franker had left the gambling-house
and was running for his life into the wilderness.

There, for three days, he lost himself. That was his idea: to lose
himself. He wanted to be lost, utterly lost to the world. For he knew
that so long as the other twin lived his own chances of living were
reduced to the last recurring decimal. Bibi or Bobo—whichever it
was—would never rest until he had wrought vengeance on his brother’s
murderer. Though it wasn’t a murder, of course, but a duel in which each
had taken the same risk of death. If Franker had not killed Bibi or
Bobo, Bibi or Bobo would have killed him. He wished he knew which of the
twins it was he had killed. So idiotic not to know. So confusing. It
made your head ache, wondering. And in your sleep you dreamed of
horrible, two-headed monsters coming at you crabwise, with arms and legs
all round them.

On the third day of his sojourn in the wilderness the other twin had
very nearly caught him napping. He had sunk down exhausted in a sandy
hollow fringed with palms, and for a moment closed his eyes. And in that
moment the redness of his lowered eyelids had been suddenly clouded by a
shadow. In an instant he was on his feet, wide awake again. And there
was the figure of the other twin in the act of flinging itself upon him.
He fired an aimless shot at that black apparition, then bolted.

And all that day and all that night he had wound and wound an intorted
course through virgin forest, hoping thus to shake off his pursuer. And
all that day and all that night he had known that his pursuer followed
him, shadowed him, stalked him, with a merciless delight in that
persecution born of an insatiate hate.

Next day Franker, having doubled on his tracks, found himself on a
quayside, and had shipped as a forecastle hand on an old iron hooker
bound for the Caribs with a mixed cargo. He never knew or cared what
that mixed cargo consisted of. He was too busy sleeping, when he wasn’t
too sore from being kicked into wakefulness, to bother about trivial
details. He could have left the ship at the first of the Caribs, but an
island is a prison, and his yearning was for wide free spaces where a
man can at least get a run for his money. So he had returned on the
hooker, and had been paid off with the lurid compliments of the purser,
and was once more adrift.

But the story of his wanderings and adventures over the greater part of
the southern hemisphere would fill many books. Months passed, a year
passed, two years, and all the while Franker was dogged by the avenger.
Ever and again, just when he thought that he had at last shaken off that
deadly pursuit, the other twin turned up again. And gradually it was
borne in upon him that the other twin might have killed him long since
had he wished. He had had numberless opportunities, and had not taken
them. This puzzled Franker a bit, and then he hit upon the truth. There
is more joy in the hunting than in the killing. There is more cat-like
satisfaction in the slow torture of its victim than in the crunching up
of its dead bones. He began to think of the other twin as a cat-like
creature, exercising a cruelty of the mind far more subtle and devilish
than any mere crude cruelty of tooth and claw. When the avenger tired of
the sport, then he would strike. And not till then. Meanwhile, Franker
was condemned to a daily round of unremitting vigilance, ceaseless
watchfulness, unending apprehension.

He had been a big man, strong and fearless, with bold eyes and the voice
of a bull. Now he had become a shuffling, whimpering, trembling thing of
nerves and tears, who dared look no one in the face lest it should be
the face of his enemy. In the old days, with no other resources than his
health and vigour, bodily and mental, he had used to take chances with
an overbearing recklessness, and thrust and curse his way through the
mob of other roustabouts like unto himself, with whom he had fought for
the means of existence. And he had been—he realised that now—quite happy
then. There were times when he told himself that he would stand fast
against his pursuer, force him into the open, then turn upon him and
rend him, and so make an end of this long-drawn-out agony. But when the
moment came his wits fled, he was distraught and afraid, he could think
only of flight.

It was now a full fortnight since he had seen Bibi—or Bobo. But there
had been other fortnights during which he had not seen him. And always,
inevitably, he had reappeared. So would he reappear again.

Franker gazed out from the shadow of the old seawall across the
glittering, limitless sea, and wished that he might drown himself in its
depths. But he was not yet quite mad enough for that. Though life had
become as a nightmare to him, and death as the awakening to the cool,
calm peace of dawn; though life offered nothing but torment, and death
offered surcease of pain, he still clung to life. It was in the nature
of his being to cling to life. He was not of the stuff that gives in.

But if only he could rest awhile! If only he could lie still in some
sheltered place, safe from his enemy, and thus regain his old control
over his faculties, recuperate his strength!

At the western end of the Lido, where the coast swept in a wide curve to
the lighthouse and the harbour, there was a long white wall. And as he
remembered what that wall enclosed, what it signified, Franker had an
inspiration. His face was suddenly irradiated. He laughed aloud. What a
fool!—God in Heaven!—what a fool he had been not to think of that
before! He rose on tremulous legs and began to shamble along the beach
towards that far-off haven of refuge.

The prison official, in his gaudy livery of gold and scarlet and his
immense cocked hat, conducted him to the chief inspector’s office.

“Yes?”

Franker desired to be sworn. He had a crime to confess: it had troubled
his conscience for years.

“Yes?”

An affair of opium smuggling, ship’s papers forged, and customs burked.
It was a true story enough, only Franker himself had not been implicated
in it. The police had been so long on the track of that crime they had
given it up as hopeless. And now here there was the chief criminal, a
fine fat bird, dropping into the net of his own free will. The chief
inspector rubbed his dry palms together as he thought of the luscious
report he would send to the magistracy.

Then he committed Franker to the custody of another prison official,
less gaudy than the first, and Franker was led away to the cell.

This was a big, bare, barn-like place of stone, that sometimes contained
as many as twenty prisoners huddled indiscriminately together. But just
now crime was slack. Franker had the whole cell to himself.

As the gaoler slammed the door on him he fell on his knees with a
weeping face, and offered up thanks for this blessed refuge, this safe
harbour of retreat from his relentless enemy, this sanctuary. Here, at
last, he was free from the fear of pursuit. Here, during the year or two
of his imprisonment, he could rest and sleep, rest his mind and find his
sleep that sweet relief from the tortures of the last two years which
would gradually restore him again to health and sanity.

Even as he prayed he toppled down face forward and lay there quite
still, breathing softly, evenly, in peaceful slumber.

The light was fading, there was a red stain of sunset on the wall when
he awoke. It was a rattling and clanging of bolts and chains that had
roused him. He sat up, blinking stupidly, at first not knowing where he
was. Then, as he remembered, he shed tears of joy again, and clasped his
hands together in an access of delight.

The sounds drew nearer. The heavy, barred door of the prison chamber was
flung open. He saw the burly figure of a gaoler over-shadowing another
smaller figure that seemed to be precipitated from behind into the misty
vastness of the cell. It fell head-long at Franker’s feet, and lay there
stirring feebly like a wounded beetle.

Franker watched his writhings ... and a slow, cold horror grew upon him.

His fellow-prisoner raised himself on all fours, then sat up and
squatted there, cross-legged, like a Chinese bonze.

It was Bibi—or Bobo.

Franker uttered a cry.

“And hast thou found me, O mine enemy!”

The other twin had leapt to his feet. He shrank back, crouching,
snarling, spitting like a cat. The moment for the happy dispatch was
come at last. He drew his knife and fingered its keen blade lovingly,
then came mincing on tiptoe towards Franker.

As Franker’s hands closed round his throat he drove the blade deep into
Franker’s breast.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
