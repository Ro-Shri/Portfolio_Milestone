ALLELUIA

By T. F. POWYS


Follow me into one of those shining days of April, when the blue in the
sky has lost its March iciness and the village of Wallbridge pauses in
its usual grey monotony to look for events.

Events come indeed, as they always do, for those who wait long enough
for them. The first intimation that something was going to happen
chanced to be picked up in the road by Mr. Tapper, labourer of Ford’s
Farm.

Mr. Tapper had once found a penny in the mud, and ever since that
eventful day the good man had kept his eye fixed upon the road when he
walked abroad.

Mr. Tapper handed the paper he had found when teatime came round to his
daughter Lily, remarking as he did so:

“’Tain’t nothink,” which merely meant, of course, that the paper wasn’t
a penny.

Lily—the pretty Lily—gave her head a little shake, and read at the top
of the printed sheet the word “Alleluia.”

It was all out then, of course, as soon as the pretty Lily had got hold
of it, all the whole merry matter of the coming of Alleluia into
Wallbridge. After he had handed in those papers at the doors—with the
exception of the ones that he wisely dropped in the road, well knowing
that anything picked up always interests—invited everyone to his
meetings. Alleluia for he must have known everyone would call him
Alleluia, began to preach and sing in a devout manner in the handsome
tent that he had set up near to his van. He was so gentle and polite and
so good at starting those emotional tunes—invented by Mr. Moody—that
Wallbridge at once praised and patronised him.

Alleluia had come down from Oxford, and his confiding and childlike
look, together with his silky moustache, had led him into the bypaths
and hedges and so on and on until he reached the village of Wallbridge.

There were, of course, troubles in even so gentle a young man’s path;
there were difficulties and doubts—little worries—so that Alleluia’s
eyes were not always without their tears.

The Wallbridge people were not always so loving as they should be. The
Rev. John Sutton, the vicar, disapproved of the preacher’s looks and was
even slightly contemptuous of the glory hymns. This unkindness hit the
young man hard, because, outwardly, the vicar seemed pleased with the
work that he was doing.

And there was Lily. Lily had to be considered even by Mr. Tapper, her
father, as something female. Mr. Tapper put her down entirely, with her
mother included, to the simple fact that he had stayed too long out one
lovely June fair day at the Stickland revels. Even that day he saw as
all Lily’s fault, feeling, truly perhaps, that the child brings her
parents together.

Even then Mr. Tapper was middle-aged, but that only made him blame Lily
the more. If it had not been for Lily, Mr. Tapper might have gone on
hawking saucepan lids and receiving beer in exchange for the country
matters in his tavern songs.

When Lily was eighteen a very important event happened to her. She
bought a new looking-glass to replace a cracked one that had always
given her face such an ugly cut down the middle. Before this new one—she
had stolen the money for it from her drunken parent’s pocket—she could
touch herself and preen herself, and wonder at a red mark on her bosom
that looked almost like a bite.

That must not happen again; of course it wouldn’t after Alleluia’s
preaching; young Wakely would have to take her home more gently in
future. Following the lovely hymns, it was not quite proper to be
covered and eaten and bitten by kisses all the way home.

“No you mustn’t, Tom.”

Pretty Lily said the words before her glass in order to practise them.
She used to sit quite near to the young preacher, and had got his
child’s look and his silky upper lip quite by heart. He would be always
speaking about love and about doing kind actions to one another, and
every hymn was filled with the delicious savour of subdued sin.

Lily was quite moved by all the excitement, but she wished to be more
careful about Tom, and so she was....

Alleluia had grown fond of looking upwards too, and for many nights he
had seen only one face in the sky. Alleluia was forced to allow that the
pretty face in the sky had nothing whatever to do with the hymns he had
been singing; he knew it was not God’s face, nor David’s, nor any other
heavenly person’s. But, alas, it so pleased Alleluia that he wandered
abroad in search of it sometimes, and often it was midnight before the
preacher opened his van door to go to bed.

                   *       *       *       *       *

The excessive longing for events to happen in a village sometimes
over-reaches itself; it did, indeed, over-reach itself this time in
Wallbridge.

As usual, events pass in a sober grey way in the country. The dismal
sermons of all the Rev. John Suttons are nearly always of the same
dismal colour. And even the Wallbridge quarrel between old Mother Wimple
and Farmer Told had become dull coloured, too. The sun shone as best it
could, and sometimes the moon would appear, though none of these
heavenly lights proved strong enough to break the leaden colouring.

But the people had longed, and when the people long something happens.

It came in this wise. A morning dawned with a splash of red, that
splashed the grey sod, that splashed the hills and the meadows, and even
gave to Farmer Told’s white cow a red blood-stained look.

Her hymn-book soaked, her pretty Sunday clothes so sadly torn, her
pretty lily face rudely beaten and broken: there was quite a little pool
of blood in the chalk-pit, the grey colour lurid for once.

This was more than peaceful Wallbridge had wished for. This dreadful
dash of red made even the April sunshine look a little queer. It could
never be the same usual Wallbridge wind that blew upon the stalwart
forms of the inspectors and policemen who had the case in hand.

Alleluia had been found, almost crazed, near the chalkpit; he had been
looking for pretty Lily all night, he said, and had only found her at
dawn. There was blood upon his clothes, he had held her body in his
arms.

Others told so much, too. They had been seen together very often; they
had been followed, watched, and the stars needs must have blushed, so
folks said. Tom Wakely had been away that red night, so it could not
have been he who had done it.

Honest Mr. Tapper gave the strongest evidence, and Alleluia was hanged.

Perhaps this was a little hard upon Alleluia, but all men said he should
have stuck to his hymn-singing and not gone out to look for pretty
lilies at night-time. One wit even remarked that he could have sung his
hymns in the town in a cheaper fashion without a stretch of the neck at
the end of it.

The red splash of pretty Lily’s blood coloured some dozen or so years of
Wallbridge life, but after that time was passed the old grey began to
hang heavy again and an owl hooted.

The owl must have settled upon Mr. Tapper’s chimney, so near did the
sound of its hooting seem to Mr. Tapper.

It was midnight, two old women—one was Mrs. Tapper—were sitting by the
dying man’s side.

“’E do die ’ard,” Mrs. Tapper remarked in a friendly tone.

Mr. Tapper was thoughtful.

“If only he hadn’t wandered off into the lanes on that fair day in June!
He might even have been drinking beer instead of dying hard.”

The owl perched upon the cottage chimney hooted again. The ice upon
Ford’s pond cracked—the midnight frost was abroad.

Mr. Tapper spoke his last words.

“Our Lily, she weren’t murdered by thik young preacher,” said Mr.
Tapper.

“Who did kill she?” the old women whispered excitedly.

“’Twas I,” said Mr. Tapper, “because young Wakely never give I thik beer
’e’d promised. I did blame she for it.”

The owl hooted, the old women looked at one another—and Mr. Tapper’s jaw
slowly dropped.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
