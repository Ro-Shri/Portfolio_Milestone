THE CRUCIFIXION OF THE OUTCAST

By W. B. YEATS

    From The Secret Rose, by W. B. Yeats.
    Copyright, 1914, by the Macmillan Company.


A man, with thin brown hair and a pale face, half ran, half walked along
the road that wound from the south to the Town of the Shelly River. Many
called him Cumhal, the son of Cormac, and many called him the Swift,
Wild Horse; and he was a gleeman, and he wore a short parti-coloured
doublet, and had pointed shoes, and a bulging wallet. Also he was of the
blood of the Ernaans, and his birth-place was the Field of Gold; but his
eating and sleeping places were the four provinces of Eri, and his
abiding place was not upon the ridge of the earth. His eyes strayed from
the Abbey tower of the White Friars and the town battlements to a row of
crosses which stood out against the sky upon a hill a little to the
eastward of the town, and he clenched his fist, and shook it at the
crosses. He knew they were not empty, for the birds were fluttering
about them; and he thought, how, as like as not, just such another
vagabond as himself was hanged on one of them; and he muttered; “If it
were hanging or bow-stringing, or stoning or beheading, it would be bad
enough. But to have the birds pecking your eyes and the wolves eating
your feet! I would that the red wind of the Druids had withered in his
cradle the soldier of Dathi, who brought the tree of death out of
barbarous lands, or that the lightning, when it smote Dathi at the foot
of the mountain, had smitten him also, or that his grave had been dug by
the green-haired and green-toothed merrows deep at the roots of the deep
sea.”

While he spoke, he shivered from head to foot, and the sweat came out
upon his face, and he knew not why, for he had looked upon many crosses.
He passed over two hills and under the battlemented gate, and then round
by a left-hand way to the door of the Abbey. It was studded with great
nails, and when he knocked at it, he roused the lay brother who was the
porter, and of him he asked a place in the guest-house. Then the lay
brother took a glowing turf on a shovel, and led the way to a big and
naked outhouse strewn with dirty rushes: and lighted a rush-candle fixed
between two of the stones of the wall, and set the glowing turf upon the
hearth and gave him two unlighted sods and a wisp of straw, and showed
him a blanket hanging from a nail, and a shelf with a loaf of bread and
a jug of water, and a tub in a far corner. Then the lay brother left him
and went back to his place by the door. And Cumhal the son of Cormac
began to blow upon the glowing turf, that he might light the two sods
and the wisp of straw; but his blowing profited him nothing, for the
sods and the straw were damp. So he took off his pointed shoes, and drew
the tub out of the corner with the thought of washing the dust of the
highway from his feet; but the water was so dirty that he could not see
the bottom. He was very hungry, for he had not eaten all that day; so he
did not waste much anger upon the tub, but took up the black loaf, and
bit into it, and then spat out the bite, for the bread was hard and
mouldy. Still he did not give way to his wrath, for he had not drunken
these many hours; having a hope of heath beer or wine at his day’s end,
he had left the brooks untasted, to make his supper the more delightful.
Now he put the jug to his lips, but he flung it from him straightway,
for the water was bitter and ill-smelling. Then he gave the jug a kick,
so that it broke against the opposite wall, and he took down the blanket
to wrap it about him for the night. But no sooner did he touch it than
it was alive with skipping fleas. At this, beside himself with anger, he
rushed to the door of the guest-house, but the lay brother, being well
accustomed to such outcries, had locked it on the outside; so Cumhal
emptied the tub and began to beat the door with it, till the lay brother
came to the door, and asked what ailed him, and why he woke him out of
sleep. “What ails me!” shouted Cumhal, “are not the sods as wet as the
sands of the Three Headlands? and are not the fleas in the blanket as
many as the waves of the sea and as lively? and is not the bread as hard
as the heart of a lay brother who has forgotten God? and is not the
water in the jug as bitter and as ill-smelling as his soul? and is not
the foot-water the colour that shall be upon him when he has been
charred in the Undying Fires?” The lay brother saw that the lock was
fast, and went back to his niche, for he was too sleepy to talk with
comfort. And Cumhal went on beating at the door, and presently he heard
the lay brother’s foot once more, and cried out at him, “O cowardly and
tyrannous race of friars, persecutors of the bard and the gleeman,
haters of life and joy! O race that does not draw the sword and tell the
truth! O race that melts the bones of the people with cowardice and with
deceit!”

“Gleeman,” said the lay brother, “I also make rhymes; I make many while
I sit in my niche by the door, and I sorrow to hear the bards railing
upon the friars. Brother, I would sleep, and therefore I make known to
you that it is the head of the monastery, our gracious Coarb, who orders
all things concerning the lodging of travellers.”

“You may sleep,” said Cumhal, “I will sing a bard’s curse on the Coarb.”
And he set the tub outside down under the window, and stood upon it, and
began to sing in a very loud voice. The singing awoke the Coarb, so that
he sat up in bed and blew a silver whistle until the lay brother came to
him. “I cannot get a wink of sleep with that noise,” said the Coarb.
“What is happening?”

“It is a gleeman,” said the lay brother, “who complains of the sods, of
the bread, of the water in the jug, of the foot-water, and of the
blanket. And now he is singing a bard’s curse upon you, O brother Coarb,
and upon your father and your mother, and your grandfather and your
grandmother, and upon all your relations.”

“Is he cursing in rhyme?”

“He is cursing in rhyme, and with two assonances in every line of his
curse.”

The Coarb pulled his night-cap off and crumpled it in his hands, and the
circular brown patch of hair in the middle of his bald head looked like
an island in the midst of a pond, for in Connaught they had not yet
abandoned the ancient tonsure for the style then coming into use. “If we
do not somewhat,” he said, “he will teach his curses to the children in
the street, and the girls spinning at the doors, and to the robbers on
the mountain of Gulben.”

“Shall I go then,” said the other, “and give him dry sods, a fresh loaf,
clean water in a jug, clean foot-water, and a new blanket, and make him
swear by the blessed St. Benignus, and by the sun and moon, that no bond
be lacking, not to tell his rhymes to the children in the street, and
the girls spinning at the doors, and the robbers on the mountain of
Gulben?”

“Neither our blessed Patron nor the sun and the moon would avail at
all,” said the Coarb: “for to-morrow or the next day the mood to curse
would come upon him, or a pride in those rhymes would move him, and he
would teach his lines to the children, and the girls, and the robbers.
Or else he would tell another of his craft how he fared in the
guest-house, and he in his turn would begin to curse, and my name would
wither. For learn there is no steadfastness of purpose upon the roads,
but only under roofs, and between four walls. Therefore I bid you go and
awaken Brother Kevin, Brother Dove, Brother Little Wolf, Brother Bald
Patrick, Brother Bald Brandon, Brother James and Brother Peter. And they
shall take the man, and bind him with ropes, and dip him in the river
that he may cease to sing. And in the morning, lest this but make him
curse the louder, we will crucify him.”

“The crosses are all full,” said the lay brother.

“Then we must make another cross. If we do not make an end of him
another will, for who can eat and sleep in peace while men like him are
going about the world? Ill should we stand before blessed St. Benignus,
and sour would be his face when he comes to judge us at the Last Day,
were we to spare an enemy of his when we had him under our thumb!
Brother, the bards and the gleemen are an evil race, ever cursing and
ever stirring up the people, and immoral and immoderate in all things,
and heathen in their hearts, always longing after the Son of Lir, and
Angus, and Bridget, and the Dagda, and Dana the Mother, and all the
false gods of the old days; always making poems in praise of those kings
and queens of the demons, Finvaragh of the Hill in the Plain, and Red
Aodh of the Hill of the Shee, and Cleena of the Wave, and Eiveen of the
Grey Rock, and him they call Don of the Vats of the Sea; and railing
against God and Christ and the blessed Saints.” While he was speaking he
crossed himself, and when he had finished he drew the night-cap over his
ears, to shut out the noise, and closed his eyes, and composed himself
to sleep.

The lay brother found Brother Kevin, Brother Dove, Brother Little Wolf,
Brother Bald Patrick, Brother Bald Brandon, Brother James and Brother
Peter sitting up in bed, and he made them get up. Then they bound
Cumhal, and they dragged him to the river, and they dipped him in at the
place which was afterwards called Buckley’s Ford.

“Gleeman,” said the lay brother, as they led him back to the
guest-house, “why do you ever use the wit which God has given you to
make blasphemous and immoral tales and verses? For such is the way of
your craft. I have, indeed, many such tales and verses well nigh by
rote, and so I know that I speak true! And why do you praise with rhyme
those demons, Finvaragh, Red Aodh, Cleena, Eiveen and Don? I, too, am a
man of great wit and learning, but I ever glorify our gracious Coarb,
and Benignus our Patron, and the princes of the province. My soul is
decent and orderly, but yours is like the wind among the salley gardens.
I said what I could for you, being also a man of many thoughts, but who
could help such a one as you?”

“My soul, friend,” answered the gleeman, “is indeed like the wind, and
it blows me to and fro, and up and down, and puts many things into my
mind and out of my mind, and therefore am I called the Swift, Wild
Horse.” And he spoke no more that night, for his teeth were chattering
with the cold.

The Coarb and the friars came to him in the morning, and bade him get
ready to be crucified, and led him out of the guest-house. And while he
still stood upon the step a flock of great grass-barnacles passed high
above him with clanking cries. He lifted his arms to them and said, “O
great grass-barnacles, tarry a little, and mayhap my soul will travel
with you to the waste places of the shore and to the ungovernable sea!”
At the gate a crowd of beggars gathered about them, being come there to
beg from any traveller or pilgrim who might have spent the night in the
guest-house. The Coarb and the friars led the gleeman to a place in the
woods at some distance, where many straight young trees were growing,
and they made him cut one down and fashion it to the right length, while
the beggars stood round them in a ring, talking and gesticulating. The
Coarb then bade him cut off another and shorter piece of wood, and nail
it upon the first. So there was his cross for him; and they put it upon
his shoulder, for his crucifixion was to be on the top of the hill where
the others were. A half-mile on the way he asked them to stop and see
him juggle for them: for he knew, he said, all the tricks of Angus the
Subtle-Hearted. The old friars were for pressing on, but the young
friars would see him: so he did many wonders for them, even to the
drawing of live frogs out of his ears. But after a while they turned on
him, and said his tricks were dull and a shade unholy, and set the cross
on his shoulders again. Another half-mile on the way, and he asked them
to stop and hear him jest for them, for he knew, he said, all the jests
of Conan the Bald, upon whose back a sheep’s wool grew. And the young
friars, when they had heard his merry tales, again bade him take up his
cross, for it ill became them to listen to such follies. Another
half-mile on the way, he asked them to stop and hear him sing the story
of White-Breasted Deirdre, and how she endured many sorrows, and how the
sons of Usna died to serve her. And the young friars were mad to hear
him, but when he had ended, they grew angry, and beat him for waking
forgotten longings in their hearts. So they set the cross upon his back,
and hurried him to the hill.

When he was come to the top, they took the cross from him, and began to
dig a hole to stand it in, while the beggars gathered round, and talked
among themselves. “I ask a favour before I die,” says Cumhal.

“We will grant you no more delays,” says the Coarb.

“I ask no more delays, for I have drawn the sword, and told the truth,
and lived my vision and am content.”

“Would you then confess?”

“By sun and moon, not I; I ask but to be let eat the food I carry in my
wallet. I carry food in my wallet whenever I go upon a journey, but I do
not taste of it unless I am well-nigh starved. I have not eaten now
these two days.”

“You may eat, then,” says the Coarb, and he turned to help the friars
dig the hole.

The gleeman took a loaf and some strips of cold fried bacon out of his
wallet and laid them upon the ground. “I will give a tithe to the poor,”
says he, and he cut a tenth part from the loaf and the bacon. “Who among
you is the poorest?” And thereupon was a great clamour, for the beggars
began the history of their sorrows and their poverty, and their yellow
faces swayed like the Shelly River when the floods have filled it with
water from the bogs.

He listened for a little, and, says he, “I am myself the poorest, for I
have travelled the bare road, and by the glittering footsteps of the
sea; and the tattered doublet of parti-coloured cloth upon my back, and
the torn pointed shoes upon my feet have ever irked me, because of the
towered city full of noble raiment which was in my heart. And I have
been the more alone upon the roads and by the sea, because I heard in my
heart the rustling of the rose-bordered dress of her who is more subtle
than Angus, the Subtle-Hearted, and more full of the beauty of laughter
than Conan the Bald, and more full of the wisdom of tears than
White-Breasted Deirdre, and more lovely than a bursting dawn to them
that are lost in the darkness. Therefore, I award the tithe to myself;
but yet, because I am done with all things, I give it unto you.”

So he flung the bread and the strips of bacon among the beggars, and
they fought with many cries until the last scrap was eaten. But
meanwhile the friars nailed the gleeman to his cross, and set it upright
in the hole, and shovelled the earth in at the foot, and trampled it
level and hard. So then they went away, but the beggars stared on,
sitting round the cross. But when the sun was sinking, they also got up
to go, for the air was getting chilly. And as soon as they had gone a
little way, the wolves, who had been showing themselves on the edge of a
neighbouring coppice, came nearer, and the birds wheeled closer and
closer. “Stay, outcasts, yet a little while,” the crucified one called
in a weak voice to the beggars, “and keep the beasts and the birds from
me.” But the beggars were angry because he had called them outcasts, so
they threw stones and mud at him, and went their way. Then the wolves
gathered at the foot of the cross, and the birds lighted all at once
upon his head and arms and shoulders, and began to peck at him, and the
wolves began to eat his feet. “Outcasts,” he moaned, “have you also
turned against the outcast?”

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
