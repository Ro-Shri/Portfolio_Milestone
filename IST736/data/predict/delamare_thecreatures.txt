THE CREATURES

It was the ebbing light of evening that recalled me out of my story to a
consciousness of my whereabouts. I dropped the squat little red book to
my knee and glanced out of the narrow and begrimed oblong window. We
were skirting the eastern coast of cliffs, to the very edge of which a
ploughman, stumbling along behind his two great horses, was driving the
last of his dark furrows. In a cleft far down between the rocks a cold
and idle sea was soundlessly laying its frigid garlands of foam. I
stared over the flat stretch of waters, then turned my head, and looked
with a kind of suddenness into the face of my one fellow-traveller.

He had entered the carriage, all but unheeded, yet not altogether
unresented, at the last country station. His features were a little
obscure in the fading daylight that hung between our four narrow walls,
but apparently his eyes had been fixed on my face for some little time.

He narrowed his lids at this unexpected confrontation, jerked back his
head, and cast a glance out of his mirky glass at the slip of
greenish-bright moon that was struggling into its full brilliance above
the dun, swelling uplands.

“It’s a queer experience, railway-travelling,” he began abruptly, in a
low, almost deprecating voice, drawing his hand across his eyes. “One is
cast into a passing privacy with a fellow-stranger and then is gone.” It
was as if he had been patiently awaiting the attention of a chosen
listener.

I nodded, looking at him. “That privacy, too,” he ejaculated, “all
that!” My eyes turned towards the window again: bare, thorned, black
January hedge, inhospitable salt coast, flat waste of northern water.
Our engine driver promptly shut off his steam, and we slid almost
noiselessly out of sight of sky and sea into a cutting.

“It’s a desolate country,” I ventured to remark.

“Oh, yes, ‘desolate,’” he echoed a little wearily. “But what frets me is
the way we have of arrogating to ourselves the offices of judge, jury,
and counsel all in one. As if this earth.... I never forget it—the
futility, the presumption. It _leads_ nowhere. We drive in—into all this
silence, this—this, ‘forsakenness,’ this dream of a world between her
lights of day and night time. We desecrate. Consciousness! What restless
monkeys men are.” He recovered himself, swallowed his indignation with
an obvious gulp. “As if,” he continued, in more chastened tones—“as if
that other gate were not for ever ajar, into God knows what of peace and
mystery.” He stooped forward, lean, darkened, objurgatory. “Don’t we
make our world? Isn’t that our blessed, our betrayed responsibility?”

I nodded, and ensconced myself, like a dog in straw, in the basest of
all responses to a rare, even if eccentric, candour—caution.

“Well,” he continued, a little weariedly, “that’s the indictment. Small
wonder if it will need a trumpet to blare us into that last ‘Family
Prayers.’ Then perhaps a few solitaries—just a few—will creep out of
their holes and fastnesses, and draw mercy from the merciful on the
cities of the plain. The buried talent will shine none the worse for the
long, long looming of its napery spun from dream and desire.

“Years ago—ten, fifteen, perhaps—I chanced on the queerest specimen of
this order of the ‘talented.’ Much the same country, too. This”—he swept
his glance out towards the now invisible sea—“this is a kind of dwarf
replica of it. More naked, smoother, more sudden and precipitous, more
‘forsaken,’ moody! Alone! The trees are shorn there, as if with
monstrous shears, by the winter gales. The air’s salt. It is a country
of stones and emerald meadows, of green, meandering, aimless lanes, of
farms set in their cliffs and valleys like rough time-bedimmed jewels,
as if by some angel of humanity, wandering between dark and daybreak.

“I was younger then—in body: the youth of the mind is for men of a
certain age; yours, maybe, and mine. Even then, even at that, I was
sickened of crowds, of that unimaginable London—swarming wilderness of
mankind in which a poor, lost, thirsty dog from Otherwhere tastes first
the full meaning of that idle word ‘forsaken.’ ‘Forsaken by whom?’ is
the question I ask myself now. Visitors to my particular paradise were
few then—as if, my dear sir, we are not all of us visitors, visitants,
revenants, on earth, panting for time in which to tell and share our
secrets, roving in search of marks that shall prove our quest not vain,
not unprecedented, not a treachery. But let that be.

“I would start off morning after morning, bread and cheese in pocket,
from the bare old house I lodged in, bound for that unforeseen nowhere
for which the heart, the fantasy, aches. Lingering hot noondays would
find me stretched in a state half-comatose, yet vigilant, on the
close-flowered turf of the fields or cliffs, on the sun-baked sands and
rocks, soaking in the scene and life around me like some pilgrim
chameleon. It was in hope to lose my way that I would set out. How shall
a man find his way unless he lose it? Now and then I succeeded. That
country is large, and its land and sea marks easily cheat the stranger.
I was still of an age, you see, when my ‘small door’ was ajar, and I
planted a solid foot to keep it from shutting. But how could I know what
I was after? One just shakes the tree of life, and the rare fruits come
tumbling down, to rot for the most part in the lush grasses.

“What was most haunting and provocative in that far-away country was its
fleeting resemblance to the country of dream. You stand, you sit, or lie
prone on its bud-starred heights, and look down; the green, dispersed,
treeless landscape spreads beneath you, with its hollow and mounded
slopes, clustering farmstead, and scatter of village, all motionless
under the vast wash of sun and blue, like the drop-scene of some
enchanted playhouse centuries old. So, too, the visionary bird-haunted
headlands, veiled faintly in a mist of unreality above their broken
stones and the enormous saucer of the sea.

“You cannot guess there what you may not chance upon, or whom. Bells
clash, boom, and quarrel hollowly on the edge of darkness in those
breakers. Voices waver across the fainter winds. The birds cry in a
tongue unknown yet not unfamiliar. The sky is the hawks’ and the stars’.
_There_ one is on the edge of life, of the unforeseen, whereas our
cities—are not our desiccated, jaded minds ever continually pressing and
edging further and further away from freedom, the vast unknown, the
infinite presence, picking a fool’s journey from sensual fact to fact at
the tail of that he-ass called Reason? I suggest that in that solitude
the spirit within us realises that it treads the outskirts of a region
long since called the Imagination. I assert we have strayed, and in our
blindness abandoned——”

                   *       *       *       *       *

My stranger paused in his frenzy, glanced out at me from his obscure
corner as if he had intended to stun, to astonish me with some violent
heresy. We puffed out slowly, laboriously from a “Halt” at which in the
gathering dark and moonshine we had for some while been at a standstill.
Never was wedding-guest more desperately at the mercy of ancient
mariner.

“Well, one day,” he went on, lifting his voice a little to master the
resounding heart-beats of our steam-engine—“one late afternoon, in my
goalless wanderings, I had climbed to the summit of a steep grass-grown
cart-track, winding up dustily between dense, untended hedges. Even then
I might have missed the house to which it led, for, hair-pin fashion,
the track here abruptly turned back on itself, and only a far fainter
footpath led on over the hill-crest. I might, I say, have missed the
house and—and its inmates, if I had not heard the musical sound of what
seemed like the twangling of a harp. This thin-drawn, sweet, tuneless
warbling welled over the close green grass of the height as if out of
space. Truth cannot say whether it was of that air or of my own fantasy.
Nor did I ever discover what instrument, whether of man or Ariel, had
released a strain so pure and yet so bodiless.

“I pushed on and found myself in command of a gorse-strewn height, a
stretch of country that lay a few hundred paces across the steep and
sudden valley in between. In a V-shaped entry to the left, and sunwards,
lay an azure and lazy tongue of the sea. And as my eye slid softly
thence and upwards and along the sharp, green horizon line against the
glass-clear turquoise of space, it caught the flinty glitter of a square
chimney. I pushed on, and presently found myself at the gate of a
farmyard.

“There was but one straw-mow upon its staddles. A few fowls were sunning
themselves in their dust-baths. White and pied doves preened and cooed
on the roof of an outbuilding as golden with its lichens as if the
western sun had scattered its dust for centuries upon the large slate
slabs. Just that life and the whispering of the wind: nothing more. Yet
even at one swift glimpse I seemed to have trespassed upon a peace that
had endured for ages; to have crossed the viewless border that divides
time from eternity. I leaned, resting, over the gate, and could have
remained there for hours, lapsing ever more profoundly into the blessed
quietude that had stolen over my thoughts.

“A bent-up woman appeared at the dark entry of a stone shed opposite to
me, and, shading her eyes, paused in prolonged scrutiny of the stranger.
At that I entered the gate and, explaining that I had lost my way and
was tired and thirsty, asked for some milk. She made no reply, but after
peering up at me, with something between suspicion and apprehension on
her weather-beaten old face, led me towards the house which lay to the
left on the slope of the valley, hidden from me till then by plumy
bushes of tamarisk.

“It was a low grave house, grey-chimneyed, its stone walls traversed by
a deep shadow cast by the declining sun, its dark windows rounded and
uncurtained, its door wide open to the porch. She entered the house, and
I paused upon the threshold. A deep unmoving quiet lay within, like that
of water in a cave renewed by the tide. Above a table hung a wreath of
wild flowers. To the right was a heavy oak settle upon the flags. A beam
of sunlight pierced the air of the staircase from an upper window.

“Presently a dark, long-faced, gaunt man appeared from within,
contemplating me, as he advanced, out of eyes that seemed not so much to
fix the intruder as to encircle his image, as the sea contains the
distant speck of a ship on its wide, blue bosom of water. They might
have been the eyes of the blind; the windows of a house in dream to
which the inmate must make something of a pilgrimage to look out upon
actuality. Then he smiled, and the long, dark features, melancholy yet
serene, took light upon them, as might a bluff of rock beneath a thin
passing wash of sunshine. With a gesture he welcomed me into the large
dark-flagged kitchen, cool as a cellar, airy as a belfry, its sweet air
traversed by a long oblong of light out of the west.

“The wide shelves of the painted dresser were laden with crockery. A
wreath of freshly-gathered flowers hung over the chimney-piece. As we
entered, a twittering cloud of small birds, robins, hedge-sparrows,
chaffinches fluttered up a few inches from floor and sill and
window-seat, and once more, with tiny starry-dark eyes observing me,
soundlessly alighted. I could hear the infinitesimal _tic-tac_ of their
tiny claws upon the slate. My gaze drifted out of the window into the
garden beyond, a cavern of clearer crystal and colour than that which
astounded the eyes of young Aladdin.

“Apart from the twisted garland of wild flowers, the shining metal of
range and copper candlestick, and the bright-scoured crockery, there was
no adornment in the room except a rough frame, hanging from a nail in
the wall, and enclosing what appeared to be a faint patterned fragment
of blue silk or fine linen. The chairs and table were old and heavy. A
low, light warbling, an occasional _skirr_ of wing, a haze-like drone of
bee and fly—these were the only sounds that edged a quiet intensified in
its profundity by the remote stirrings of the sea.

“The house was stilled as by a charm, yet thought within me asked no
questions; speculation was asleep in its kennel. I sat down to the milk
and bread, the honey and fruit which the old woman laid out upon the
table, and her master seated himself opposite to me, now in a low
sibilant whisper—a tongue which they seemed to understand—addressing
himself to the birds, and now, as if with an effort, raising those
strange grey-green eyes of his to bestow a quiet remark upon me. He
asked, rather in courtesy than with any active interest, a few
questions, referring to the world, its business and transports—_our_
beautiful world—as an astronomer in the small hours might murmur a few
words to the chance-sent guest of his solitude concerning the secrets of
Uranus or Saturn. There is another, an inexplorable side to the moon.
Yet he said enough for me to gather that he, too, was of that small
tribe of the aloof and wild to which our cracked old word ‘forsaken’
might be applied, hermits, lamas, clay-matted fakirs, and such-like; the
snowy birds that play and cry amid mid-oceanic surges; the living of an
oasis of the wilderness; which share a reality only distantly dreamed of
by the time-driven thought-corroded congregations of man.

“Yet so narrow and hazardous I somehow realised was the brink of
fellow-being (shall I call it?) which we shared, he and I, that again
and again fantasy within me seemed to hover over that precipice Night
knows as fear. It was he, it seemed, with that still embracive
contemplation of his, with that far-away yet reassuring smile, that kept
my poise, my balance. ‘No,’ some voice within him seemed to utter, ‘you
are safe; the bounds are fixed; though hallucination chaunt its decoy,
you shall not irretrievably pass over. Eat and drink, and presently
return to life.’ And I listened, and, like that of a drowsy child in its
cradle, my consciousness sank deeper and deeper, stilled, pacified into
the dream which, as it seemed, this soundless house of stone now reared
its walls.

“I had all but finished my meal when I heard footsteps approaching on
the flags without. The murmur of other voices, distinguishably shrill
yet guttural even at a distance, and in spite of the dense stones and
beams of the house which had blunted their timbre, had already reached
me. Now the feet halted. I turned my head—cautiously, even perhaps
apprehensively—and confronted two figures in the doorway.

“I cannot now guess the age of my entertainer. These children—for
children they were in face and gesture and effect, though as to form and
stature apparently in their last teens—these children were far more
problematical. I say ‘form and stature,’ yet obviously they were
dwarfish. Their heads were sunken between their shoulders, their hair
thick, their eyes disconcertingly deep-set. They were ungainly; their
features peculiarly irregular, as if two races from the ends of the
earth had in them intermingled their blood and strangeness; as if,
rather animal and angel had connived in their creation.

“But if some inward light lay on the still eyes, on the gaunt,
sorrowful, quixotic countenance that now was fully and intensely bent on
mine, emphatically that light was theirs also. He spoke to them; they
answered—in English, my own language, without a doubt: but an English
slurred, broken, and unintelligible to me, yet clear as a bell,
haunting, penetrating, pining as voice of nix or siren. My ears drank in
the sound as an Arab parched with desert sand falls on his dried belly
and gulps in mouthfuls of crystal water. The birds hopped nearer as if
beneath the rod of an enchanter. A sweet continuous clamour arose from
their small throats. The exquisite colours of plume and bosom burned,
greened, melted in the level sun-ray, in the darker air beyond.

“A kind of mournful gaiety, a lamentable felicity, such as rings in the
cadences of an old folk-song, welled into my heart. I was come back to
the borders of Eden, bowed and outwearied, gazing from out of dream into
dream, homesick, ‘forsaken.’

“Well, years have gone by,” muttered my fellow-traveller deprecatingly,
“but I have not forgotten that Eden’s primeval trees and shade.

“They led me out, these bizarre companions, a he and a she, if I may put
it as crudely as my apprehension of them put it to me then. Through a
broad door they conducted me—if one who leads may be said to be
conducted—into their garden. Garden! A full mile long, between
undiscerned walls, it sloped and narrowed towards a sea at whose dark
unfoamed blue, even at this distance, my eyes dazzled. Yet how can one
call that a garden which reveals no ghost of a sign of human
arrangement, of human slavery, of spade or hoe?

“Great boulders shouldered up, tessellated, embossed, powdered with a
thousand various mosses and lichens, between a flowering greenery of
weeds. Wind-stunted, clear-emerald, lichen-tufted trees smoothed and
crisped the inflowing airs of the ocean with their leaves and spines,
sibilating a thin scarce-audible music. Scanty, rank, and uncultivated
fruits hung close their vivid-coloured cheeks to the gnarled branches.
It was the harbourage of birds, the small embowering parlour of their
house of life, under an evening sky, pure and lustrous as a water-drop.
It cried, ‘Hospital’ to the wanderers of the universe.

“As I look back in ever-thinning, nebulous remembrance on my two
companions, hear their voices gutturally sweet and shrill, catch again
their being, so to speak, I realise that there was a kind of Orientalism
in their effect. Their instant courtesy was not Western, the smiles that
greeted me, whenever I turned my head to look back at them, were
infinitely friendly, yet infinitely remote. So ungainly, so far from our
notions of beauty and symmetry were their bodies and faces, those heads
thrust heavily between their shoulders, their disproportioned yet
graceful arms and hands, that the children in some of our English
villages might be moved to stone them, while their elders looked on and
laughed.

“Dusk was drawing near; soon night would come. The colours of the
sunset, sucking its extremest dye from every leaf and blade and petal,
touched my consciousness even then with a vague fleeting alarm.

“I remember I asked these strange and happy beings, repeating my
question twice or thrice, as we neared the surfy entry of the valley
upon whose sands a tiny stream emptied its fresh water—I asked them if
it was they who had planted this multitude of flowers, many of a kind
utterly unknown to me and alien to a country inexhaustibly rich. ‘We
wait; we wait!’ I think they cried. And it was as if their cry awoke
echo from the green-walled valleys of the mind into which I had strayed.
Shall I confess that tears came into my eyes as I gazed hungrily around
me on the harvest of their patience?

“Never was actuality so close to dream. It was not only an unknown
country, slipped in between these placid hills, on which I had chanced
in my ramblings. I had entered for a few brief moments a strange region
of consciousness. I was treading, thus accompanied, amid a world of
welcoming and fearless life—oh, friendly to me!—the paths of man’s
imagination, the kingdom from which thought and curiosity, vexed
scrutiny and lust—a lust it may be for nothing more impious than the
actual—had prehistorically proved the insensate means of his banishment.
‘Reality,’ ‘Consciousness’: had he for ‘the time being’ unwittingly,
unhappily missed his way? Would he be led back at length to that garden
wherein cockatrice and basilisk bask, harmlessly, at peace?

“I speculate now. In that queer, yes, and possibly sinister company,
sinister only because it was alien to me, I did not speculate. In their
garden, the familiar was become the strange—‘the strange’ that lurks in
the inmost heart, unburdens its riches in trance, flings its light and
gilding upon love, gives heavenly savour to the intemperate bowl of
passion, and is the secret of our incommunicable pity. What is yet
queerer, these things were evidently glad of my company. They stumped
after me (as might yellow men after some Occidental quadruped never
before seen) in merry collusion of nods and wreathed smiles at this
perhaps unprecedented intrusion.

“I stood for a moment looking out over the placid surface of the sea. A
ship in sail hung phantom-like on the horizon. I pined to call my
discovery to its seamen. The tide gushed, broke, spent itself on the
bare boulders, I was suddenly cold and alone, and gladly turned back
into the garden, my companions instinctively separating to let me pass
between them. I breathed in the rare, almost exotic heat, the tenuous,
honeyed, almond-laden air of its flowers and birds—gull, sheldrake,
plover, wagtail, finch, robin, which as I half-angrily, half-sadly
realised fluttered up in momentary dismay only at _my_ presence—the
embodied spectre of their enemy, man. Man? Then who were these?...

“I lost again a way lost early that morning, as I trudged inland at
night. The dark came, warm and starry. I was dejected and exhausted
beyond words. That night I slept in a barn and was awakened soon after
daybreak by the crowing of cocks. I went out, dazed and blinking into
the sunlight, bathed face and hands in a brook near by, and came to a
village before a soul was stirring. So I sat under a thrift-cushioned,
thorn-crowned wall in a meadow, and once more drowsed off and fell
asleep. When again I awoke, it was ten o’clock. The church clock in its
tower knelled out the strokes, and I went into an inn for food.

“A corpulent, blonde woman, kindly and hospitable, with a face
comfortably resembling her own sow’s, that yuffed and nosed in at the
open door as I sat on my stool, served me with what I called for. I
described—not without some vanishing shame, as if it were a treachery—my
farm, its whereabouts.

“Her small blue eyes ‘pigged’ at me with a fleeting expression which I
failed to translate. The name of the farm, it appeared, was Trevarras.
‘And did you see any of the Creatures?’ she asked me in a voice not
entirely her own. ‘The Creatures’? I sat back for an instant and stared
at her; then realised that Creature was the name of my host, and Maria
and Christus (though here her dialect may have deceived me) the names of
my two gardeners. She spun an absurd story, so far as I could tack it
together and make it coherent. Superstitious stuff about this man who
had wandered in upon the shocked and curious inhabitants of the district
and made his home at Trevarras—a stranger and pilgrim, a ‘foreigner,’ it
seemed, of few words, dubious manners, and both uninformative.

“Then there was something (she placed her two fat hands, one of them
wedding-ringed, on the zinc of the bar-counter, and peered over at me,
as if I were a delectable ‘wash’), then there was something about a
woman ‘from the sea.’ In a ‘blue gown,’ and either dumb, inarticulate,
or mistress of only a foreign tongue. She must have lived in sin,
moreover, those pig’s eyes seemed to yearn, since the children were
‘simple,’ ‘naturals’—as God intends in such matters. It was useless.
One’s stomach may sometimes reject the cold sanative aerated water of
‘the next morning,’ and my ridiculous intoxication had left me dry but
not yet quite sober.

“Anyhow, this she told me, that my blue woman, as fair as flax, had died
and was buried in the neighbouring churchyard (the nearest to, though
miles distant from Trevarras). She repeatedly assured me, as if I might
otherwise doubt so sophisticated a fact, that I should find her grave
there, her ‘stone.’

“So indeed I did—far away from the elect, and in a shade-ridden
north-west corner of the sleepy, cropless acre: a slab, scarcely
rounded, of granite, with but a name bitten out of the dark, rough
surface, ‘_Femina Creature_.’”

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
