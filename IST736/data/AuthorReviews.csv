Author,Rating,Review
Poe,4,My first time to read and finish a collection by Edgar Allan Poe and I was just blown away. This was one of my two Halloween reads this year and it made my long Halloween weekend truly worth remembering.
Poe,4,"The best (so far) poem in this collection. It is many things to me: it is painful and sad (the speaker is lamenting the lost of his love Lenore - see #25) yet it is musical and not really gloomy, overall. The verses are playful and you can imagine the raven flying in the air, through the window, and settling on the statue. The raven also talks - it keeps on saying ""Nevermore"" - and it adds to the childlike playful prose. It is sad yet it is happy (in a way). However, the playful scene ends when the speaker begins to talk to the raven while sitting on the statue of Pallas. He asks if he is to be reunited with Lenore and when the raven says ""Nevermore,"" he gets angry and the feeling of doom dawns on the poem."
Poe,1,VERY creepy! We were forced to read it in English... AHH!!!
Poe,3,"One of my favorite childhood books. Yes, I had one weird childhood.
"
Poe,3,I think makes Poe so memorable is his vivid first-person accounts from the point of view of a killer.
Poe,3,"Silly, amusing, but ends a bit too abruptly."
Poe,5,This was my first ever collection i have read of mr. Poe and I enjoyed most of the stories in this collection. The collection was my pick for all hallow's read to read for Halloween this year. I also hosted a readalong of this collection online on facebook andat the all about books book club on goodreads. This month from october 20th through tonight we read and discussed the stories by poe that was in this collection along with the novel A narrative of A. Gordon Pym. It also included my favorite poe story The Masque of the Red Death which I first read in middle school. It is still a favorite to this day. The only stories I did not enjoy were diddling and the man that was used up. I would definitely reccomend this colle ction to others
Poe,5,"This is my favorite of all Poe's stories. (Which considering my love for him, was not an easy choice to make.) I have read it several times over, numerous times out-loud and in scary voices to entertain my little brother :). It's incredible how Poe can write in this helter skelter fashion so that you really don't know exactly what's going on-- and then in one final paragraph, or even the final sentence, he brings it all together and has you so thoroughly creeped out and simultaneously blown your mind, you need to go back and re-read it immediately. He was an opium induced genius and no one can ever compare to his rhythmic, sing-song, and deliriously fluid writing."
Poe,2,"Look, I know he's very famous and I know he's written some good stuff but hear me out: this is not the Poe collection that you want. Yes, it contains ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" which is a five star horror story if ever there was one. Yes, it also contains a selection of his other short stories, which admittedly I do not find as excellent as many do, but which I would still give a solid three stars in general. HOWEVER. Fully one half of this particular edition is not a short story at all. It is the entire 200 pages of Poe's only novel, ""The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket"" - and I have no hesitation in saying that it is a strong contender for the worst novel ever written. Seriously, the thing is dire. It's patched together and badly edited. My favourite example of how disastrous this is comes in the death of a man aboard ship. His arm has been injured. It turns gangrenous and nasty, starts to putrefy in a number of disgusting ways. Yet when this poor victim dies and is in the process of being tossed overboard, it's not his disintegrating arm, black to the shoulder, that falls off, no. It's his leg. Poe did not notice. Clearly neither did his editor. I imagine they'd both given up by then."
Poe,3,after reading this im pretty sure there is a corpse (or many) in the walls of one of EAP’s old houses. Worrying
Poe,3,"I liked these stories, some more than others. I was a Poe fan before and glad to revisit these stories. Some of the language though was hard to get through. You can infer a lot from context, but at times felt like I needed a dictionary."
Poe,3,"Poe's stories are so varied. Some put me to sleep, some are good and all are dark and creepy. My favorite has always been ""The Fall of the House of Usher"". Poe is also mentioned in another book I'm reading now. That imply that must live crypts and corpses and from his stories it would appear he does."
Poe,2,"A short story on my book reader. Frankly, I was disappointed. It was such a famous story, maybe my expectations were to high. A lot of complicated sentences. And I had to run to the dictionary several times. Maybe that was the style back then. Worth reading if you are into the horror genre"
Poe,5,"I love Edgar Allan Poe-- what a storyteller! And this short story was one of his greatest achievements. A story of an old decrepit building that's a haunting window into the evil that resided within its walls. I also enjoyed how it symbolizes a state of building within each one of us, ostensibly perfect on the outside but shattered and fragile on the inside. Amazing story!"
Poe,4,I love how vividly edgar allen poe brings together a story in so little time.
M.R. James,4,"M.R. James, the leading exponent of the antiquarian ghost story and the writer who is regarded as having laid down the rules for modern ghost fiction maintained tha ghosts had to be malevolent or odious. That description certainly fits the being whose recrudescence from the past haunts the cathedral of his tale."
M.R. James,4,"In comparison to the early chillers penned by the Master, this story is different, and relies more upon psychological effects than atmospheric. But despite being erudite with an undertone of dark humour, this story is claustrophobic and horrific. Obviously recommended."
M.R. James,3,"Well this was certainly more exciting that its title suggested. Here, James presents the eerie consequences suffered by a rural English town, when, during controversial restorations of a church, an undisclosed tomb is discovered underneath the altar. This is one of James's better ghost stories. The ending bares strong similarities to many other of his stories ... the guy seems to have a thing for ""hairy"" monsters ... but all the same, the execution was fresh and creepy this time around."
M.R. James,5,"Read it for Halloween, or if you want a good scare."
M.R. James,5,This was another wonderful gothic horror story from M.R. James. A historian learns of a dark chapter in the history of a cathedral. Church is no place of refuge. Wonderfully narrated.
M.R. James,2,"Every so often it's good to dip into a classic. Alas, this was the sort of classic that reminded me why it's precisely every so often and not more frequently than that. Widely beloved, widely lauded these are suppose to be among the finest tales of supernatural fiction and yet they didn't do it for me at all. I tried and tried, took several sittings. The book's page count is misleading, it's entered as 94 on GR and 122 on Amazon and yet by my account considering the time spent reading it and the fact that it comprises parts 1 & 2 of James' stories, also published as separate volumes, this should clock out at well over 200 pages. And feels much slower than that. And the thing is objectively I can tell these are suppose to be good stories, quality writing, atmospheric, imaginative...and yet at no point did I find myself engaged or even particularly interested. In fact I think the main reason I finished these is due to my completist nature and general need to try to understand why I wasn't enjoying these stories the way everyone seems to. Were they dated? Sure, but that wasn't the main detraction. I expected them to be dated. Maybe it was the somnolent pacing. Or the fact that these stories were so utterly unexciting. Either way this really didn't work for me, neither entertained as a book should nor spooked as a genre book ought to. It occurred to me that these tales might be more fun if read aloud, maybe this should have been a listen and not a read. In book form...disappointing. But try I did."
M.R. James,3,"I was quite honestly surprised by just how much I enjoyed these stories. I am not, generally speaking, a fan of much horror and I felt that these stories may fall into that space. But, a friend recommended, and so I tried. What I loved about these was the suspense and how clear the characters were painted. It wasn't gory and it wasn't really scary. It was just good fiction. These would probably be best read aloud. "
M.R. James,5,"If you can trudge through the old-world language and be patient to wait for the spooks to walk again, you'll be blown away by who was probably the best ghost-story author ever. The collection will still cause the hairs to raise on the back of your neck, as well as cause goose bumps."
M.R. James,5,Understated creepiness at its best.
M.R. James,2,I couldn't understand much of what I read because the stories need some serious editing. I ended up not reading it because of this.
M.R. James,4,"These were delightful. Creepy, yes, but also witty. I chortled several times at his descriptions of boring conversations (usually golf related). Just be prepared to encounter a myriad of archaic words, though these tales do hold up well otherwise"
M.R. James,2,"Listened to this collection as an audiobook. I really enjoy Emma Topping's voice and clear enunciation, and the matter-of-fact way she narrates the stories strikes me as very pleasant. Bart Wolffe just sounds so over the top, though, that his narration comes across as gimmicky -- and not in a good way."
M.R. James,5,"M.R. James masterfully creates the eerie and suspenseful atmosphere that brings these tales to life. Written as a sort as stories obtained by an antiquarian, it gives the sort of sitting by the fireplace and telling stories feel. The nightmarish entities in this book, are fueled by the author's mastery of suggestion, similar to the style of H.P. Lovecraft. I highly recommend giving this a read as my words cannot do justice."
M.R. James,3,"The ghosts, or at least their reveals, are often not very scary. James excels at the verisimilitude (especially via his detached, academic narrators), at setting a stage that seems quite real. He is less skilled at making the ghosts seem real, or, as I said frightening. Of all the stories here, I liked ""The Mezzotint"" the most for a clever approach to revealing the story, and an effective mood."
M.R. James,4,"Just like the successor to this book, M.R. James sure does love his latin. Entire paragraphs of it, after which he notes ""I suppose I had better translate."" Yes, you should indeed. Especially enjoyed ""Number 13."" And while in general things are well-creepified in these stories, I found it hard to be truly terrified by possessed PJs"
Blackwood,5,"Terrific collection of Blackwood's best-known tales, including ""The Willows"" and ""The Wendigo."" Calling these thirteen tales ""ghost stories"" may be something of a misnomer, as Blackwood is hard to classify -- perhaps ""supernatural tale"" would be more appropriate. In his most effective tales, he slowly draws the reader into a downward spiral of dread and terror, creating a palpable sense of a malevolent unknowable or unspeakable something. This ability to arouse and sustain terror is what is truly remarkable about Blackwood's writing. It's remarkable that he keeps the reader's spellbound attention while essentially simply describing a psychological sort of unwinding or inchoate impressions."
Blackwood,3,"I picked up this book because I had read, more than once, that ""The Willows"" is considered by many to be the best ghost story ever written. I'm not sure that I would agree. A well-written tale that had me feeling a little ""edgy"" at times, it didn't really sustain itself for me. I realize that many might confuse the ""ghost"" story with a ""horror"" story, and they are not necessarily the same (though they can be), but a ghostly presence ought to run a shivver up my spine, and this didn't, though perhaps it came close."
Blackwood,5,"""the willows"" is so scary i was reading it aloud to my wife and she made me stop before i finished. then i walked the dog and the dog kept looking over his shoulder and stopping, he was petrified. also, Blackwood has a tremendous vocabulary, it's fun to look up words like ""rosacrutian."""
Blackwood,3,"Some of these tales simply didn't age well, but that is not the case with Blackwood's two classics, ""The Willows"" and ""The Wendigo,"" both of which have lost none of their fearful, imaginative power."
Blackwood,4,It's really hard to beat a Blackwood ghost story
Blackwood,4,Creepy. Master of atmosphere. Guy can spook with a phrase.
Blackwood,5,"Thanks to my son-in-law for loaning me this book! These are some delightfully chilling ghost stories, written in a style that you just don't see much, any more. I love a good ghost story, and am quite fond of the short story genre, so this is a doubly good offering. These stories were written between 1906 and 1938."
Blackwood,2,"I didn’t finish, but didn’t feel compelled to. Some of the stories were good (Willows, Secret Worship) others predictable and drawn out beyond belief."
Blackwood,2,"a few of the stories were standout great, but mostly I skimmed it."
Blackwood,4,I think this was the most I have ever enjoyed reading short stories.
Blackwood,5,"Blackwood inspired Lovecraft. Need I say more? If you've read all of Lovecraft then start reading Blackwood. Same eerie hinted at, atmosoheric, horror. The willows is one of the best short stories I've ever read."
Blackwood,2,"It must be me, because everyone else is giving this short novel a 4 or 5 stars, but I honestly fail to see the appeal to this book, I found it mildly creepy, mostly boring and repetitive."
Blackwood,3,"Not what I expected. This short story will either be the longest 50 pages of your life, or the most suspenseful piece of literature you will ever read. In the end, I thought this story dealt a little too much with the emotions the narrator was feeling. It seemed that each paragraph either mentioned a new emotion or was devoted completely to describing an emotion. All in all, it was a pretty good read and a must read for those interested in a ""fourth dimension"" and how humans relate to and perceive their surroundings."
Blackwood,1,"I find it puzzling that this novela is so highly rated (4.2 stars at the time of this writing) because I think, having read this as well as 2 other works by Algernon Blackwood, that this one is by far the weakest of the three. It compares a lot to The Man Whom the Trees Loved yet it fails to capture the mystical experience as the fear is far too predominant. The Man Whom the Trees Loved on the other hand captures the mystical experience beautifully from the dual perspective of fear of, and the welcoming of the Great Beyond. Your mind stretches from side to side, sometimes afraid but sometimes curious. It's just a much better story than this one."
Blackwood,5,"When I start a story this good, I find myself getting worried. Will it stay this atmospheric, this subtle, clever, evocative? Fortunately, Algernon Blackwood carries his tour de force to the end. It's the hardest kind of horror to do, the unnameable. Unlike with concrete nasties such as sharks, serial killers and zombies, unmentionable forces can soon end up in a series of increasingly less effective abstractions. But when subtle, cosmologically horror is pulled off successfully, as in here, it is so much more effective. Who'd have thought willows jiggling in high wind could be made so scary? In a way, this story is just as much science fiction as horror, through the way it suggests entities inhabiting dimensions beyond ours, more products of a different physics than the supernatural. I'd rank this as one of the all-time great weird tales, as well as one of the all-time great sci-fi yarns. No wonder H.P. Lovecraft was so enamoured of it - it became the template for his own writing."
Stoker,1,"I was rather disappointed by this classic. It started out with promise, especially the Jonathan Harker bits. Then all the male characters descended into blubbering worshippers of the two female characters, and by the end of the novel, I was wishing Dracula could snack on all of them and be done with it. I kept having to put it aside and read chapters in between other books, but I managed to finish it at last."
Stoker,3,"I've grown to appreciate this more with age - especially as I've put more distance between myself and the time I studied Dracula at school. But I still think it's overrated. Dracula isn't nearly scary enough, Jonathan Harker is a wet mop of a protagonist, Mina is annoying and the best character [spoiler alert!] gets killed less than halfway into the book."
Stoker,3,"Meh, it wasn’t as great as I was hoping. Sucks too because I love this beautiful little door stopper of a book. I hugged it often! Bastards! Making something so adorable that’s going in the trade in box. Sigh. I really loved the beginning, and don’t get me wrong, it was still good ....just not fantastic for me. I’m glad most everyone else in the world loved it"
Stoker,1,"This novel was an absolute ordeal to get through. The beginning is compelling what with the vivid descriptions of Dracula castle and how Jonathan Harker reaches it. But what ensues will put you to sleep. Lucy's deterioating health is described in excruciating detail and the ominous count Dracula is intimidated and defeated amazingly easily for someone with such devestating supernatural powers. Also, he hardly appears in the novel. The whole story line basically just consists of convoluted journal entries. The fact that certain characters such as Mina and Renfield are able to read the count's mind just constitutes a deep-seeded flaw in Stoker's narrative style. In spite of the fact that this is billed as a horror novel it is completely devoid of thrills and tension. It frustrates me that novels of this quality are remembered and spawn infinite movie adaptations and spin-offs while the works of genuinely talented and original authors sink into oblivion."
Stoker,4,"Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” is one of the classics- having picked it up a while ago, I figured why not read it during this, the spookiest of months?
I rate the classic somewhere in the 3.5 star mark (rounded up to 4 for Goodreads). I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning, when lawyer Jonathan Harker was held captive by the elusive Count Dracula. Once Harker escaped, and took into his acquaintance Professor Van Helsing, I grew bored of the story for a while. I really enjoyed Dr. Seward’s storyline with the mentally insane patient, but beyond that- there was little else of interest. Van Helsing was far too chatty- and his pedantic dialogue expanded the story for far longer than necessary in most segments.
Stoker’s use of correspondence (from the view points of the protagonists’) as a way to tell the story was original- it also broke the story down into small chunks (told from alternating perspectives) which increased my enjoyment of the novel’s plot.
The ending drew me back in again- when the group went on a hunt for the mysterious Count in order to kill him and save one of their own, and the final conclusion of the novel was satisfying and concrete. I enjoyed most of Stoker’s characters (except, as mentioned, Van Helsing- although he was so necessary to the story that he couldn’t really be left out) and really felt a connection to young Mina, as she struggled to help her husband and his comrades while being under the Count’s spell.
This novel had the right amount of originality, creativity and spookiness and I am grateful that I had the chance to read it (finally!) I really enjoyed this version of the novel, as it detailed a timeline of the author’s life, which I found thoroughly interesting. Stoker definitely deserves to be labeled as a classic, and his writing is not as archaic or difficult to understand as some of his counterparts from that time. A good read for those who are looking for some solid, spooky reading that has stood the test of time."
Stoker,5,i am obsessed. this was bloody fantastic. (pun intended.)
Stoker,5,"I was surprised at how creepy certain parts of the story were. Especially, the Jonathan Harker trapped in Dracula's castle chapters. I thought the scene where he found the Count's sleeping situation was very suspenseful. The writing was fantastic. I've realized I'm not a fan of certain gothic tropes, like madmen in asylums, or virtuous women that need to be saved because of how ""pure"" they are. The way the men were describing Mina in the last quarter of the book had me rolling my eyes. It's a classic and has done so much for the horror and specifically the vampire genre, but there were a few things I just didn't love on the reread."
Stoker,2,I couldn't get interested in any of the three characters of the love triangle especially the female character Sarah who was a very shallow vain and quite a dislikeable person.
Stoker,3,"I didn't find this a very interesting story, but it's not bad."
Stoker,4,"I enjoy Bram Stoker’s writing more and more with each work of his I read. This one has the setting done stunningly, getting you into the mood for the story. Despite the fact that the characters were kind of unlikable, you could resonate with them from some point of view. It’s not a horror story, maybe just chilling. It’s a good one though for some psychology study. Reaaally enjoyed it, I recommend it to anyone"
Stoker,4,Malcomson needs time for his studies and rents a deserted old house. It was once owned by a mean judge. At late hours he always hears rats in the wainscot. Besides he's irritated when he sees an extremely large rat near the cord for the alarm bell. That cord has a very eerie pre-history and plays an important part in the later part of the story. An extremely eerie gothic tale by the old master. I liked the plotting and the fine crafted character. Also the characterization of the judge is extremely well done. And the eyes of the rat. Nothing for people who are afraid of rats or of mean judges. Recommended!
Stoker,5,"Although this is quite a short story it is as full of gripping tension, foreboding and anticipation as you would expect from Stoker. It follows a young student who rents an old empty house in a small English village for peace and quite so he can study. Unfortunately that's not quite what he gets as the house is invested with rats...and something/someone else. This story will certainly make you think the next time your looking at the photographs of people past if you go a-wandering through the rooms of historic houses, especially those that have ropes hanging beside their fireplaces."
Stoker,2,"Creepy, atleast for me, the author managed to made the reader feel goosebump by the words he chose. but the story lacks some factor, i think he should have used other animals instead of rat, or if he sticks on using rat as a medium, he should have ended the story with the evil rat in a more realistic way."
Stoker,3,"A bone-chilling read.. Well.. Who better than Bram Stoker to play with our own fears in such a way.?! I really liked the story.. It had all the elements- forewarnings, movement of inanimate objects, disturbed animals, strong climatic conditions- in the right proportion. I could see the fate of the student when the use of the rope was described by the doctor."
Stoker,5,"I am personally not a big fan of Bram Stoker, in fact, my feelings and thoughts tend to be at the opposite end of the emotional spectrum, but this story is just ghastly and absolutely wonderful. If there is one piece from Bram Stoker I can recommend from my heart, it's this one."
